# LLM Fine-Tuning for arXiv Paper Classification

This project fine-tunes a pretrained language model using PyTorch to classify arXiv paper abstracts into categories such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Robotics, etc.

The pipeline includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Tokenization and dataset preparation
- Fine-tuning a Hugging Face model using native PyTorch
- Evaluation and predictions

The goal is to build a custom classifier that can automatically tag new paper abstracts with their correct subject area.
